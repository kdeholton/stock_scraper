This project assumes that you have a SQL database set up somewhere.

The database must have two tables, with names and columns as follows:

Table name: 'ticker'
Columns: name, symbol, date, time, ask, bid

Table name: 'daily_summary'
Columns: name, symbol, date, open, close, prev_close, high, low


This has no sanitation whatsoever! Please ensure that the user that is making these accesses has only the permissions they need and none more. This is not ideal.
